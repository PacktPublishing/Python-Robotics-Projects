# Python Robotics Projects
This is the code repository for [Python Robotics Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/python-robotics-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788832922), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Robotics is a fast-growing industry. Multiple surveys state that investment in the field has increased tenfold in the last 6 years, and is set to become a $100-billion sector by 2020. Robots are prevalent throughout all industries, and they are all set to be a part of our domestic lives. This book starts with the installation and basic steps in configuring a robotic controller. You'll then move on to setting up your environment to use Python with the robotic controller. You'll dive deep into building simple robotic projects, such as a pet-feeding robot, and more complicated projects, such as machine learning enabled home automation system (Jarvis), vision processing based robots and a self-driven robotic vehicle using Python.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
for i in range(3):
  GPIO.output(23, GPIO.HIGH)
sleep(.5)
GPIO.output(23, GPIO.LOW)
sleep(.5)
sleep(1)
```

This book is for those who have a will to learn robotics and get familiar with the latest technology using the latest programming language. Age is no limit whether you are 12 years young or 60 years old; you can read this book and convert your ideas into reality.
